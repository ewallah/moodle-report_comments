moodle-report_comments

Comments in Moodle can be great for collaborative work. They can be made inside the comments block, databases, assignments, blogs, glosaries and wikis.

For a teacher it is not easy to have a quick and complete view who commented what, when and where. This report is added on user and course level, so facilitators can get an overview for each course and user they teach.

Moreover, when someone post a comment, a notification is generated for all teachers.
